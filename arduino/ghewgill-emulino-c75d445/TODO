CPU core:
- More useful built-in peripheral implementations
- Analog inputs and outputs
- PWM outputs
- Cycle-correct emulation including interrupt handling
- Interactive AVR code debugger (gdb RSP adapter?)

GUI:
- Integration with the Arduino IDE as a separate run target (instead of avrdude)
- A GUI framework around the emulator with a full-noise visual debugger
- Virtual oscilloscope
- Drag and drop circuit components (integration with Fritzing?)
